# InstaPost

InstaPost is a open-source tool to create news post to Instagram (or any social media). The goal of this project is to provide an automated way to create this kind of posts.

There is still a lot of work to do, so if you have suggestions, feel free to create an Issue.

# How to use

## Get an API Key

To get a valid key, visit [Newscatcher API](https://rapidapi.com/newscatcher-api-newscatcher-api-default/api/newscatcher) and follow the steps to generate one.

[Download the source-code](https://github.com/gustavobecelli/InstaNews/archive/main.zip), or clone this repository in your machine.
In your terminal, simply install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

After that, in `app.js`, you will see something like this:

```js
const news = require('./functions/news')
const key = 'Your key here' // (RapidAPI)
// This API accepts any keywords, but only accepts until 100 articles per request.
console.log('Making request...')
news.generate('AI', '100', key)
```

In the second line, you will insert your API Key as a string. For example:

```js
const key = 'da3jdss23lp42j24g94mm3k432ij24n' // This is a ficticius key
```

In the last line, the two first fields are the search term and the quantity of the articles. Feel free to change these fields. But remember, the API accepts until 100 articles per request. For example:

```js
news.generate('Search Term', '50', key)
```

After changing the fields, simply run on your terminal:

```
node app.js
```
